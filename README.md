# Polyominoes

A **polyomino** is a plane geometric figure formed by joining one or more equal squares edge to edge. It is a polyform whose cells are squares. They are clasified by the number of squares they have, usually called ***n***. More information can be found in this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyomino).

The code in this repo obtains all possible non-isomorphic polyominoes made of *n* squares. It is important to emphasize in the non-isomorphic property to avoid adding the same ones but rotated, reflected or both at the same time. One example is the following:
